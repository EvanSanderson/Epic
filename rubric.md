## Backend Technology
Performing. Your Api has two models and they work well. Although I would consider adding an endpoint to grab stories on a per epic basis. Re: comments in angular show controller ~line 25.

## Front-end Technology
Excelling. Great Job using angular maps. You guys did use both `$scope` and `vm, I would probably just use one or the other. There are definitely some refactoring opportunities, but it works great and looks amazing!

## Code Quality
Performing. Code is pretty well indented formatted for the most part. I would encourage more commenting, especially in collaborative projects. Not just header comments but details on what the code actually does. Also consistency with `$scope`/vm(use one or the other) Also checkout John Papa's angular style guides.


## Deployment Functionality
Performing. App is deployed, works great!

## Planning/Process/Submission
Excelling. I was largely hands off throughout the project week for yall group. The self organization and planning was amazing too see! It all came together really nicely.
